# BabySleepParentsCanWork
A system for new parents can work after baby get sleep.

Owlet smart socks and camera system are good systems for monitoring baby, however the Owlet camera is sucks. YI camera is a way cheaper and better option for monitoring babies. I am gonna combine these two together to one, and use the app to monitor the baby. 

App platform: iOS and Chrome Plugin

To-do-list:

- [ ] Read live video from Yi camera
- [ ] Read heart rate and oxygen level Owlet smart socks. 
- [ ] Display on one screen.
